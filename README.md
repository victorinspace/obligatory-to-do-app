## Summary

This To-Do application is made with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

During this project, I learned about Session Storage and gained more insight in how to use vanillla JavaScript to interact with the DOM, reacting to user input. The title of this project is inspired by the D&D spell mechanic in which a player can speak a "word of power" to cast powerful magic. In this case, the word of power allows the visitor to complete whatever tasks lay before them.
